## Introduction

throughout my programming journey, i always stumble to this tip from various resources,
"Learn a programming language by heart". Upon hearing this a gazillion times, i still
just cant figure out what language do i have to choose, its like committing to
a marriage lol. In my mind, every language is capable of doing anything, building
everything that you want. But i often forget that each programming language has
some kind an expertise in a field. Until recently, despite my 3 years on programming,
i just finally want to commit to a language, C++.

## Back Story

This 3 years of my programming journey, its very patchy, like i know glimpses of
this and that, but its just nothing that i really know by heart, not for a bad reason
aside from maybe just my adhd kicking, but everything about computer always amaze me,
i just wanna know everything. But then i found out about system engineering,
and woah, its just calling me inside lol, its fascinating how vast that field,
it could lead to HPC, DB, OS, GPU programming, infra, even firmware. After research,
i had a couple of options, and got shortened to C++, Rust, and Zig. Took me awhile
to finally choose c++.

## Why

Because of these reasons i asked myself:

- what do i want to build?
- what can i tolerate?
- what position am i at in terms of skill issue-ness?

okay so i want to build anything relate to OS, HPC including infra stuff, and
GPU stuff.

and with the skill issue-ness, i realized i need a language that forces me to learn memory management and how the machine actually ticks. i want to struggle so i can learn.

## The Candidates

**Rust**: the modern, safe choice. everyone recommends it. the borrow checker is genius, but sometimes it feels like a helicopter parent. i want to be able to make mistakes and understand _why_ they are mistakes, rather than just being told "no". also, the ecosystem for some legacy systems stuff just isn't quite at c++ levels yet.

**Zig**: honestly, super tempting. "no hidden control flow" is a dream. but it's young. like, really young. i'm looking for a marriage, a long-term stable partner, not a summer fling that might change significantly in a year.

**C++**: the chaotic evil (or maybe lawful evil?). it's the industry standard for everything i want to build. games, engines, databases, high-frequency trading. it gives me the keys to the kingdom and the gun to shoot my foot off. it's mature, battle-tested, and everywhere.

so yeah, i choose c++. it's going to be painful. there will be undefined behavior. there will be segmentation faults. but i think it's the relationship i need to grow as an engineer right now.

till `std::terminate` do us part.
